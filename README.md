Bioinformatic analyses in collaboration with Niklas Wahlberg lab

I include all of the bioinformatic steps to go from bam files to demographic analyses. Here is a outline of the steps
  1. The bam files were generated by NW lab
  2. For Freebayes SNP calling, I needed to add read groups to these bam files that includes their metadata
  3. Using these new bam files, I then called SNPs for all samples per chromosome, then joined these back together for a full set of VCF files.
  4. These VCF files were then filtered for quality.
  5. Bed files were then generated so that I could mask the repetitive regions of the genome, as well as the N regions, and those that had low read coverage in the bam files.
  6. The SMC++ input files were then generated, using this mask, for each population in a composite likelihood framework
  7. SMC++ was then run for demographic inference
